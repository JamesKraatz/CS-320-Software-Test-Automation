- [x] How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Use automated testing tools like Junit to consistently test the components of my application. Review the specifications and derive test limits and parameters from them. Look for failure points and conditions to test in the code and implement tests to cover them. Additionally, identify expected outcomes that can be tested.

- [x] How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Identify software requirements from specification and determine user stories. User stories assist to fill in understanding the purpose of the specifications and their purpose. Also, I attempt to keep constant communication open to the stakeholder of the application to ensure the user stories are properly understood so proper test conditions and software can be accurately developed.

- [x] How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software by identify the goal of the software, translate the goal into steps or components needed to fulfill the goal, and then derive test conditions to confirm the functionally proper implementation of those components. As the goal is broken into steps and those steps are refined into finer components, an iterative development cycle is then ensued by defining a test and then developing the code to pass that test, and repeating this process until the finely grained user story is completed.
